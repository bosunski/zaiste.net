Common Lisp and Clojure have different foundations. Common Lisp is primarly an imperative language. It operates on mutable objects. It has various data-structures each with different set of functions. Clojure is a functional programming language. The core data-structures are immutable. It provides the `seq` abstraction over all its data-structures. This mechanism provides an uniform interface for interacting with those data-structures.
