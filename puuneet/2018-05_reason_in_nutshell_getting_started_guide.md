This tutorial intends to provide a comprehensive, but relatively short introduction to Reason.

[Reason](https://reasonml.github.io/) is a programming language built on top of [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/). It provides functional and object-oriented features with type-safety and focus on performance. It was created at Facebook. Its syntax is similar to JavaScript. The intention is to make interoperation with JavaScript and adoption by JavaScript programmers easier. Reason can access both JavaScript and OCaml ecosystems. OCaml was created in 1996. It is a functional programming language with infered types.

The Reason website contains an [online playground](https://reasonml.github.io/en/try.html). It allows to play with the language and see how the generated JavaScript looks like. It can also convert from OCaml to Reason.

## Why

1. In JavaScript types annotation, linting or unified formatting is provided as an external depenency such as Flow, TypeScript, ESLint or Prettier. Reason provides these features out-of-the-box. This makes the development process more streamlined and convenient.
2. Reason offers support for React with [ReasonReact](https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/). It also supports JSX syntax (HTML-like syntax used in React) out-of-the-box.
3. Reason has also the ability to generate native binaries. The generated code is performant. There is no VM overhead. It provides one binary which facilites deployment process.

## How it works

Reason is compiled to OCaml's abstract syntax tree. This makes Reason a transpiler. OCaml cannot be run directly in the browser. The AST can be
converted to various targets. BuckleScript can be used to compile that AST to JavaScript. It also provides the interop between OCaml and JavaScript
ecosystems.

BuckleScript is extremly fast and generates readable JavaScript. It also provides the Foreign Function Interface (FFI) to allow interoperability with the JavaScript existing libraries. Check [BuckleScript benchmarks](https://github.com/neonsquare/bucklescript-benchmark). BuckleScript is used at Facebook by the Messanger team and at Google by WebAssembly spec interpreter. Check the [Bucklescript demo](http://bloomberg.github.io/bucklescript/js-demo/) here. BuckleScript was created by [Hongbo Zhang](https://twitter.com/bobzhang1988/).

## Hello Reason

We will use BuckleScript to generate a Reason project. The tool provides ready-to-use project templates known as `themes`.

Let’s start by installing `bs-platform` globally:

    npm install -g bs-platform

We can now use `bsb` binary provided by `bs-platform` to generate a project scaffold. We will use `basic-reason` template to start with the most basic
Reason project structure.

    bsb -init reason-1 -theme basic-reason

    Making directory reason-1
    Symlink bs-platform in /Users/zaiste/code/reason-1

Here's the Reason directory structure generated from `basic-reason` template via BuckleScript:

    .
    ├── README.md
    ├── bsconfig.json
    ├── lib
    ├── node_modules
    ├── package.json
    └── src
        └── Demo.re

`bsconfig.json` contains BuckleScript configuration for a Reason project. It allows to specify files to compile
via `sources`, BuckleScript dependencies via `bs-dependencies`, additional flags for the compiler and more.

Next step is to build the project. This will take Reason code and pass it through BuckleScript to
generate JavaScript. By default the compiler will target Node.js.

    npm run build

    > reason-1@0.1.0 build /Users/zaiste/code/reason-1
    > bsb -make-world

    ninja: Entering directory `lib/bs'
    [3/3] Building src/Demo.mlast.d
    [1/1] Building src/Demo-MyFirstReasonml.cmj

Finally we can run our application by using `node` on the files generated by BuckleScript.

    node src/Demo.bs.js

    Hello, BuckleScript and Reason!



## Syntax 101

In this section, I will go over the syntax elements that I found the peculiar, new or just different.

### Modules

In Reason files are modules. There are no `require` or `import` statements as in JavaScript or similar programming languages. The module definitions
must be prefixed with the module name to work externally. This feature comes from OCaml. As a result you can freely move the module files in the
filesystem without the need to modify the code.

### Functions

Functions are defined using `let` and `=>`.

    let greet = name =>
      Js.log("Hello, " ++ name "!");

    greet("Zaiste");

The `++` operator is used to concatenate strings.

Function's input arguments can be labelled. This makes the function invocation more
explicit: passed-in values no longer need to follow the arguments order from the
function definition. Prefixing the argument name with `~` makes it labelled.

    let greet = (~name, ~location) =>
      Js.log("Hello, " ++ name "! You're in " ++ location);

    greet(~location="Vienna", ~name="Zaiste")

### Data Structures


#### Variants

A [variant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagged_union) is a data structure that holds a value from a fixed set of values. This is also known as tagged or disjoint union or algebraic data types. Each case in a variant must be capitalised. Optionally, it can receive parameters.

    type animal =
      | Dog
      | Cat
      | Bird;


#### Records

This is a record

    let p = {
      name: "Zaiste",
      age: 13
    }

Records need explicit type definition.

    type person = {
      name: string,
      age: int
    };

In the scope of a module, the type will be inherited: the `p` binding will be recognized as `person` type. Outside of a module, you can reference the type by just prefixing it with file name.

    let p: Person.person = {
      name: 'Sean',
      age: 12
    };

There is a convention to create a module per type and name the type as `t` to avoid the repetition i.e. `Person.t` instead of `Person.person`.

### Async Programming & Promise

There is a built-in support for Promises via BuckleScript, provided as `JS.Promise` module. Here's an example of making an API call using [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API):

    Js.Promise.(
      Fetch.fetch(endpoint)
      |> then_(Fetch.Response.json)
      |> then_(json => doSomethingOnResponse(json) |> resolve)
    )

You need to use `then_` as `then` is reserved word in OCaml.

### Pattern Matching

Pattern matching is a dispatch mechanism based on the shape of the provided value. In Reason, pattern matching is implemented with `switch` statement. It can be used with a variant type or as destructuring mechanism.

    switch pet {
    | Dog => "woof"
    | Cat => "meow"
    | Bird => "chirp"
    };

We can use pattern matching for list destructuring:

    let numbers = ["1", "2", "3", "4"];
    switch numbers {
    | [] => "Empty"
    | [n1] => "Only one number: " ++ n1
    | [n1, n2] => "Only two numbers"
    | [n1, _, n3, ...rest] => "At least three numbers"
    };

Or, we can use it for record destructuring

    let project = {name: "Huncwot", size: 101101, forks: 42, deps: [{name: "axios"}, {name: "sqlite3"}]}

    switch project {
    | {name: "Huncwot", deps} => "Matching by `name`"
    | {location, years: [{name: "axios"}, ...rest]} => "Matching by one of `deps`"
    | project => "Any other situation"
    }

### Optional values

`option()` is a built-in variant in Reason describing "nullable" values:

    type option('a) = None | Some('a);

### Varia

- `unit` means "nothing"
- `unit => unit` is a signature of a function that doesn't accept any input parameters and doesn't return any values; mostly used for callback functions

## React in Reason

### Hello ReactReason

[ReasonReact](https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/) is a Reason built-in feature for creating React applications.

Let's create a ReasonReact project using BuckleScript and its `react` template.

    bsb -init reasonreact-1 -theme react

This method is recommended by Reason team for scaffolding ReasonReact projects. It is also possible to use yarn with [reason-scripts](https://github.com/reasonml-community/reason-scripts) template for a more complete starting point.

ReasonReact provides two types of components: `statelessComponent` and `reducerComponent`. Contrary to stateless components, reducer components are stateful providing Redux-like reducers.

    let s = ReasonReact.string

    let component = ReasonReact.statelessComponent("App");

    let make = (~message, _children) => {
      ...component,
      render: _self =>
        <h1 class="header">(s(message))</h1>
    };

As described earlier `~` designates a labelled argument to freely order function's input parameters. `_` in the binding name tells the compiler that the argument isn't used in the body of that function. The spread operator (`...`) alongside of `component` means that we extend an existing component. In this example we also overwrite the `render` function.

JSX in Reason is more strict than in React: we need to explicitly wrap strings with `ReasonReact.string()`. For convenience, I've created a shorter binding called `s` to use it conveniently inside JSX block.

### Building non-trivial ReactReason app

Let's build a ReactReason application that goes beyond displaying predefined data. We will create a GitHub viewer for trending repositories. The intention is to showcase how to integrate with an external API, how to manage state and how to use React's lifecycle methods methods.

For the purpose of this example we will use [reason-scripts](https://github.com/reasonml-community/reason-scripts) to bootstrap our Reason project.

    yarn create react-app reasonreact-github --scripts-version reason-scripts

Install dependencies:

    cd reasonreact-github
    yarn

Start it with:

    yarn start

**Repository** is the central concept in this application. Let's start by defining a type to describe that entity. We will put it inside a separate module called `Repo`.

    type t = {
      name: string,
      size: int,
      forks: int
    };

From now on we can refer to this type with `Repo.t` from any Reason file in our application without the need of requiring it.

### Managing State

We've already seen a stateless component. Now let's create a component that has state. In our context we will be using `RepoList` component managing a list of trending repositories fetched from GitHub's API.

Let's start by defining the type for the state managed by `RepoList` component.

    type state = {
      repos: list(Repo.t)
    };

There is, however, a catch. Initially, before the list of trending repositories is fetched from
GitHub API, the `repos` is undefined. Reason type system doesn't allow us to have undefined value though.
We could model that initial state with an empty list, but this is not optimal. Empty list could also
mean that our query for fetching trending repositories didn't return any results.

Let's use Reason's optional values to deal with that situation.

    type state = {
      repos: option(list(Repo.t))
    }

Next step is to define possible actions for that component. In ReasonReact, actions are represented as variants. For now we will only have one action called `ReposFetched`.

    type action =
      | ReposFetched(list(Repo.t));

In order to create a stateful component in ReasonReact we need to use `reducerComponent()` function.

    let component = ReasonReact.reducerComponent("App");

Such component allows to define a reducer which describes how the state is transformed in
response to actions. A reducer takes an action along with the current state as input
and returns the new state as output. Reducers must be pure functions.

    reducer: (action, _prevState) => {
      switch action {
      | ReposFetched(repos) =>
        ReasonReact.Update({repos: Some(repos)})
      }
    }

We're pattern matching action, based on the parameter we receive in the reducer() method. Pattern matching must be exhaustive. All variant values must be matched. `reducer` definition is placed inside component's `main` function.

To finish off component's definition, let's define its initial state:

    initialState: () => {
      repos: Some([
        {name: "Huncwot", size: 11011, forks: 42}
      ])
    }

### Integrating with API

We will use [`bs-fetch`](https://github.com/reasonml-community/bs-fetch) to fetch data from an external API. It is a BuckleScript library that acts as
a thin layer on top of the Fetch API. Once the data is fetched, we will use `bs-json` to extract fields we are
interested in.

Start by installing `bs-fetch` and `bs-json`:

    npm i bs-fetch @glennsl/bs-json

Add them to `bs-dependencies` in your `bsconfig.json`:

    {
      "bs-dependencies": [
        ...,
        "bs-fetch",
        "@glennsl/bs-json"
      ]
    }

We defined our `Repo` type as a set of three fields: `name`, `size` and `forks`. Once the payload is
fetched from GitHub API we parse it to extract those three fields.

    let parse = json =>
      Json.Decode.{
        name: json |> field("name", string),
        size: json |> field("size", int),
        forks: json |> field("forks", int),
      };

`field` is a method of `Json.Decode`. The `Json.Decode.{ ... }` (mind the dot)
opens `Json.Decode` module. Its properties can now be used within these curly
brackets without the need of prefixing with `Json.Decode`.

Since GitHub returns repos under `items`, let's define another function to get that list.

    let extract = (fields, json) => Json.Decode.(json |> at(fields, list(parse)));

Finally we can make a request and pass the returned data through our parsing functions:

    let list = () =>
      Js.Promise.(
        Fetch.fetch(endpoint)
        |> then_(Fetch.Response.json)
        |> then_(text => extract(["items"], text) |> resolve)
      );

### React Lifecycle Methods

Let's use `didMount` lifecycle method to trigger the fetch of repositories from
GitHub API.

    didMount: self => {
      let handle = repos => self.send(ReposFetched(repos));
      Repo.list()
      |> Js.Promise.then_(repos => {
           handle(repos);
           Js.Promise.resolve();
         })
      |> ignore;
    }

`handle` is a method that dispatches `ReposFetched` action to the reducer. Once the promise
resolves, the action will carry fetched repositories to the reducer. This will update our state.

### Rendering

Since we distinguish between non initialized state and an empty list of repositories, it is
straightforward to handle the initial **loading in progress** message.

    render: self =>
      <div>
      (
        switch self.state.repos {
        | None => s("Loading repositories...");
        | Some([]) => s("Emtpy list")
        | Some(repos) =>
        <ul>
            (
            repos
            |> List.map((repo: Repo.t) => <li> (s(repo.name)) </li>)
            |> Array.of_list
            |> ReasonReact.array
            )
        </ul>
        }
      )
      </div>
    };

### Error handling

### Types in CSS

Types for CSS with [`bs-css`](https://github.com/SentiaAnalytics/bs-css).

    yarn add bs-css

    "bs-dependencies": [
      ...,
      "bs-css"
    ]

    let style =
      Css.(
        {
          "header": style([backgroundColor(rgba(111, 37, 35, 1.0)), display(Flex)]),
          "title": style([color(white), fontSize(px(28)), fontWeight(Bold)]),
        }
      );

    let make = _children => {
      ...component,
      render: _self =>
        <header className=style##header>
          <h1 className=style##title> (s("This is title")) </h1>
        </header>
    };
